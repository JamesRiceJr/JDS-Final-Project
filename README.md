# JDS-Final-Project
Final Project for Tomi Mester's Junior Data Scientist's First Month (JDS) Course


This is a data science project completed for Tomi Mester's course, Junior Data Scientist's First Month. 
It involves analyzing logs from a fictional travel blog and developing recommendations from the data for how the business owner strategically expand his investment of time and money in the business.
My approach was to use bash and python in a jupyter notebook with the recommendations presented in a slide deck.

If you are having trouble viewing this notebook, I have also uploaded it to Google Colaboratory, available at the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r2SpRqrXHJVx1vpcL43y9ttNpkLzU5HH?usp=sharing
